Python Program to Add Two Numbers
=================================================
In this program, you will learn to add two numbers and display it using print() function.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:


In the program below, we've used the + operator to add two numbers.

Example 1: Add Two Numbers
---------------------------
# This program adds two numbers

num1 = 1.5
num2 = 6.3

# Add two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

# Display the sum
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))

Output

The sum of 1.5 and 6.3 is 7.8
The program below calculates the sum of two numbers entered by the user..
miles = kilometers * conv_fac
print('%0.2f kilometers is equal to %0.2f miles' %(kilometers,miles))

Enter first number: 1.5
Enter second number: 6.3
The sum of 1.5 and 6.3 is 7.8

In this program, we asked the user to enter two numbers and this program displays the sum of two numbers entered by user.

We use the built-in function input() to take the input. Since, input() returns a string, we convert the string into number using the float() function. Then, the numbers are added.

Alternative to this, we can perform this addition in a single statement without using any variables as follows.

print('The sum is %.1f' %(float(input('Enter first number: ')) + float(input('Enter second number: '))))
